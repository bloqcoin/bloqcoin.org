Bloqcoin pool can have as many miners connect as you wish. Each miner can be configured to use its own
pool rewards address. varDiff is optional and will only be used for the ports you configure it for.

"ports": {
    "3032": { // The port for miners to connect to via Stratum Protocol
        "diff": 32, // The pool difficulty for this port

        // Variable difficulty is a feature that will automatically adjust difficulty for
        // individual miners based on their hashrate in order to lower networking overhead
        "varDiff": {
            "minDiff": 8, // Minimum difficulty
            "maxDiff": 512, // Network difficulty will be used if it is lower than this
            "targetTime": 15, // Try to get 1 share per this many seconds
            "retargetTime": 90, // Check to see if we should retarget every this many seconds
            "variancePercent": 30 // Allow time to very this % from target without retargeting
        }
    },
    "3256": { // Another port for miners to connect to, this port does not use varDiff
        "diff": 256 // The pool difficulty
    }
