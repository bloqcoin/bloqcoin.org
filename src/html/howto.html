			<h1>How to get started using your GPU to mine for Bloqcoin on Windows</h1>

			<p>
				<strong>Money for only running your computer!? It's more likely than you might think! No referral pyramid scam shit, you can make as much money as you have computing power to devote.</strong></p>
			<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><strong>***Also note that since the difficulty is very high right now, unless you have a very significant aggregate hash rate (over say 300-500Mhash/sec) you are probably going to be better off mining for a pool; unless of course you don't mind possibly waiting many weeks/months to generate a block and get 50 bloqcoins.***<br>
				</strong></span></p>
			<p>This post is aimed mostly at people who are already familiar with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806/http://www.bloqcoin.org/" target="_blank">Bloqcoin</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloqcoin" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a>), and would like to get started using their GPU(s) to mine for bloqcoins in a Windows environment.<br>
				Just some quick terminology: miner = program which is external to bloqcoin-qt.exe that uses your graphics card to perform calculations; your GPU is much more efficient at the type of calculations bloqcoin does than your CPU</p>
			<p>First of all, you are going to need a graphics card that supports CUDA and/or OpenCL; most graphics cards from the past 2-3 years will support this.<br>
				<span style="color: rgb(178, 34, 34);"><strong>*UPDATE*:</strong> If you are unsure, please download <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806/http://www.ozone3d.net/gpu_caps_viewer/" target="_blank">GPU Caps Viewer</a> (I recommend the portable version) to determine if you have a compatible video device and a working version of OpenCL installed. <strong>If you are using an AMD/ATI card you likely need to install the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806/http://developer.amd.com/gpu/AMDAPPSDK/downloads/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">ATI APP SDK</a></strong> (make sure you obtain the correct version for 32/64-bit Windows).<br>
				<em>(Please Note: this guide was written using 2 NVIDIA GTX275 graphics cards and will work using the most recent version of the official NVIDIA drivers.)</em></span></p>
			<p>Please make sure you are using the most recent drivers for your particular graphics card.</p>
			<p><strong><u>Important:</u> Make sure that windows explorer is configured to show file extensions and show hidden folders - In windows explorer go to tools(alt+t)</strong>→<strong>folder options</strong>→<strong>view tab</strong>→<strong>tick the show hidden files/folders button, and also make sure the box for hide file extensions is <em>unchecked</em>. This is very important or you may end up trying to create bloqcoin.conf.txt without even realizing the .txt extension is still present!<br>

			<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="background-color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 255);"><u><strong>Too Long; Didn't Read / Easy and somewhat automated version:<br>
				</strong></u></span></span></span></p>
			<p><strong>1.</strong> Go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806/http://www.bloqcoin.org/" target="_blank">www.bloqcoin.org</a>, download and install the most recent version of bloqcoin (the default file path should be fine).</p>
			<p><strong>2.</strong> A GUI-based tool exists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806/https://bloqcointalk.org/?topic=3878.0" target="_blank">here</a> which will help to speed this up and will automate a lot of the setup steps. Go to the linked forum thread, download and extract the archive somewhere, and then run <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">guiminer.exe</span>.</p>
			<p><strong>3.</strong> From the GUIMiner interface, click solo utilities → set bloqcoin client path. Point the dialog box to <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">bloqcoin-qt.exe</span>; likely located at <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Bloqcoin\bloqcoin-qt.exe</span> or <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files\Bloqcoin\bloqcoin-qt.exe</span>. Next click solo utilities → create solo password. Pick anything arbitrary for username and password but remember it, as you will need to use this later. Then finally you want to click solo utilities → launch bloqcoin client as server.</p>
			<p>This will launch bloqcoin ready to be mined with, you must first wait for all the blocks to be downloaded before you can start to mine, and this may take several hours; you can view the current block count <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806/http://blockexplorer.com/q/getblockcount" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>4.</strong> Once all the blocks are downloaded, select solo from the server drop down box, then enter the username and password that you used before, then click start mining. Congratulations, you are now mining for bloqcoins <img alt=":D" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806im_/http://www.newslobster.com/wp-content/plugins/fckeditor-for-wordpress-plugin/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/teeth_smile.gif" title=":D"></p>
			<p><strong>(Recommended) 5.</strong> Since the difficulty is high now, you will only likely see an immediate return if you mine as part of a pool. The GUI Miner will greatly expedite pool setup and you can find some more information about pools <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806/http://www.newslobster.com/bloqcoin/how-to-set-up-pooled-bloqcoin-mining-in-windows" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Additional notes:</strong> The GUI Miner also does not display the actual console window of poclbm or whatever miner you may be using; this may be desirable for some people.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="background-color: rgb(0, 128, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 255, 0);"><u><strong>Long, manual set up version using batch scripts and the command prompt:<br>
				</strong></u></span></span></span></p>
			<p><strong><span style="color:#800000;"><em>Please note that the long version of this guide will show you how to do everything manually and via the command line. This is somewhat advanced and only recommended if you are comfortable manually creating/editing text files and using the command prompt.<br>
				</em></span></strong></p>
			<p><strong>1.</strong> To start, head over to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806/http://www.bloqcoin.org/" target="_blank">http://www.bloqcoin.org/</a> and download the latest windows client. Install it to wherever you want, but it may be of benefit to keep the directory path somewhat simple, because batch scripts and launching from the command line will follow. For argument's sake, I will just assume you are using the default install path on the 64-bit version of windows, so your install directory may be:</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Bloqcoin</span></p>
			<p>At the time of writing, the latest version of bloqcoin is 0.3.23, and your overall path to bloqcoin-qt.exe should be:</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Bloqcoin\bloqcoin-qt.exe</span></p>
			<p>To start, open up a command prompt (windows key + r → type cmd → hit enter), and then navigate to the directory where bloqcoin-qt.exe is located. If you've been following along with my examples, you will want to type this into the command prompt window:</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Bloqcoin</span></p>
			<p><strong>2.</strong> Put the command prompt aside for just a second, because before launching bloqcoin, you will need to create a text file called <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">bloqcoin.conf</span> (the location of this file will vary depending on which version of Windows you are using)</p>
			<p>If you are using Windows 7 or Vista, navigate to:<br>
				<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Bloqcoin</span></p>
			<p>If you are using Windows XP, navigate to:<br>
				<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Bloqcoin</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">(You will probably need to create the "Bloqcoin" directory, as bloqcoin-qt.exe will auto-create it on first run, but you haven't yet run it… This is also where showing hidden folders comes into play, because on Windows 7 the AppData directory is hidden; Application Data may be hidden on XP as well)<br>
				</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Inside the appropriate folder, just right click and select new</span></span>→text document, then rename this file to <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">bloqcoin.conf</span></p>
			<p>Once you have created this file, open it up with your favorite text editor and add the following 2 lines (don't forget to save it when finished):</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">rpcuser=youruser<br>
				rpcpassword=yourpw<br>
				</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Where <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">youruser</span> and <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">yourpw</span> should be any arbitrary username and password; this is supplied to the miner later on via command line so that the miners can communicate with bloqcoin-qt.exe (these are the values that bloqcoin expects, if the miner specifies different values at launch you will likely get RPC errors).</span></p>
			<p><strong>3.</strong> Next, you want to start bloqcoin-qt.exe with the '<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">-server</span>' argument specified. This tells bloqcoin that there will be external programs running and allows bloqcoin to communicate with them. To do so, bring your command prompt back into focus and type:</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">bloqcoin-qt.exe -server</span></p>
			<p>(alternatively you can just launch bloqcoind.exe from the \daemon directory, which is the GUI-less client, but I prefer to use the GUI client. Using bloqcoind.exe is equivalent to launching bloqcoin-qt.exe with the arguments -server -daemon specified)</p>
			<p>Now you will see bloqcoin start up for the first time. Your client must first download the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806/http://www.bloqcoin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=block_chain" target="_blank">block chain</a> before you will be able to start generating coins, and this is done automatically on first startup. You will see the number of blocks begin to increase over time, and at the time of writing there are 130,805 blocks (you can view the current block count <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806/http://blockexplorer.com/q/getblockcount" target="_blank">here</a>). This can take several hours so be patient and let it do its thing. This process can be sped up if you forward port 8333 TCP on your router, but this is not required.</p>
			<p><strong>4.</strong> Next, head on over to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806/https://bloqcointalk.org/?topic=1334.0" target="_blank">this thread</a> and download the latest <strong><em>poclbm_py2exe</em></strong> binary from the first post. There are other miners available which work in windows, but m0mchil's is the one that I use and this guide will instruct how to set up this particular miner. (poclbm stands for (I believe…) <u>P</u>y<u>O</u>pen<u>CL</u> <u>B</u>itcoin <u>M</u>iner)</p>
			<p>If you have been following along so far, I would suggest that you create a new directory inside <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Bloqcoin</span> to reflect the latest version of the windows binary. At the time of writing the most recent version is <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">poclbm_py2exe_20110709</span>, so you should create a new directory</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Bloqcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709</span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
				</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">and then extract the contents of the archive to this new folder. The executable which will be used is </span>poclbm.exe</span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">, but this must be launched via command line and given several launch parameters. This can be tedious to do on windows, so we will expedite this with a batch script.</span></span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> (and your final path<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"> to poclbm.exe s</span>hould be </span></span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Bloqcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709\</span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">poclbm.exe)</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>5.</strong> You can place the batch script anywhere you like; I put mine on my desktop for easy access. </span></span>Right click again and create a new text file, then rename it to <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">whatever_you_want.bat</span>, all that matters here is the <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">.bat</span> extension. Right click on this file and hit edit (double clicking on it will launch it). In this batch file you want to put the following contents (this is assuming you're following the convention of this guide so far - if you are using your own directory structure, then use whatever location you have chosen instead):</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">start /D"C:\Program Files (x86)\Bloqcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709" poclbm.exe youruser:yourpw@localhost:8332 --device=0<br>
				</span><strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">(Similarly, for using a pool you can do something like this:&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">start /D"C:\Program Files (x86)\Bloqcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709" </span><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">poclbm.exe http://poolworker.1:pool_pw1@api2.bloqcoin.cz:8332 --device=0</span></span><strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"> )</span><br>
				</span></strong></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">***(</span><strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Important Note: </span></strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Some people have been having issues with the batch script failing to launch initially. It seems that it may be important to specify your device number along with the rest of the launch parameters on each line of the batch script. This can be done by simply specifying <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">--device=X</span>, where X is the number of your desired video device; most likely 0. If you have multiple devices, then the 2nd device is likely "1", and so on; if you are using onboard video I am not sure how this would work…)***<br>
				</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">"start" just tells the batch script to start a new process in its own window, the /D parameter specifies the directory that the program is located in (this allows the batch script to be launched from anywhere on your computer), and then poclbm.exe is just the target program, followed by the arguments it needs to run properly. Make sure to use the same user and password that you specified earlier in your bloqcoin.conf file. Quotes are needed whenever paths have a space in them.<br>
				</span></span></p>
			<p>Now all that's left to do is save this file and wait until bloqcoin finishes downloading all the blocks; <u><strong><span style="color:#b22222;"><em>you cannot generate until you have acquired all blocks</em></span></strong></u>.<br>
				(<strong>You may end up waiting a long time for this to finish, so if you want to take some time to go read more about bloqcoins and how the system works, now is a good time</strong> <img alt="" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806im_/http://www.newslobster.com/wp-content/plugins/fckeditor-for-wordpress-plugin/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/shades_smile.gif" title=""> )</p>
			<p>Once all blocks have been acquired, make sure bloqcoin is running with the -server switch, then simply double click on your batch file. A new window should pop up and after a few seconds. If all is going well, your hashrate will be displayed. When you want to exit just "x" out of the window or press ctrl-c.</p>
			<p>You can make a batch script to launch bloqcoin-qt.exe with the -server argument as well, its contents should look something like this:<br>
				<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">start /D"C:\Program Files (x86)\Bloqcoin"</span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"> bloqcoin-qt.exe -server<br>
				</span></p>
			<p>If you have more than one graphics card, you can use them both at the same time by doing something similar to this within your batch file:</p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">start /D"C:\Program Files (x86)\Bloqcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709" poclbm.exe </span></span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">youruser:yourpw@localhost:8332</span><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"> --device=0<br>
				start /D"C:\Program Files (x86)\Bloqcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709" poclbm.exe </span></span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">youruser:yourpw@localhost:8332</span><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"> --device=1<br>
				</span></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">for however many devices you use. This will open up a new window for each graphics card and show each card's hashrate.</span></span></p>
			<p>Another switch you may want to play around with is the -w switch, which indicates the worksize for your card to use; for example:</p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">start /D"C:\Program Files (x86)\Bloqcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709" </span></span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">youruser:yourpw@localhost:8332</span><span style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"> --device=0 -w 256<br>
				</span></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">By default, m0mchil's miner will use the maximum work size supported by your card, most likely 256 or 512. </span></span>You can play around with different sizes to see which gives you the highest hashrate; the size must be a power of 2. You will know if you have exceeded your card's maximum size if the miner errors or crashes when you try to start it <img alt=";)" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806im_/http://www.newslobster.com/wp-content/plugins/fckeditor-for-wordpress-plugin/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/wink_smile.gif" title=";)"><br>
				I use nvidia GTX275s, my maximum work size is 512 but I seem to get the best hashrate with 256. Going too small will greatly lower your hashrate and could possibly be used as a way to throttle power usage (I have only tested the effects of worksize on hashrate and not on power consumption or core temperature)</p>
			<p>You can also play around with the -v argument, but with my NVIDIA cards this seems to make poclbm.exe crash after a few seconds.</p>
			<p>Something which was changed in recent versions seems to make the miner more aggressive with GPU resources. If you notice your desktop is being sluggish you can mitigate this by adding:</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">-f 60<br>
				</span></p>
			<p>to the end of each line of your batch script. I'm not sure what exactly this does, but for a small cost in hashrate (maybe 1-2mhash, if that) your desktop will be much more responsive while mining for bloqcoins.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Assuming you have gotten this far and everything works, you can add the totals of each individual hashrate from your GPU(s), and put the grand total into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806/http://www.alloscomp.com/bloqcoin/calculator.php" target="_blank">this calculator</a> to get an idea of how much you can earn daily (if you use a pool). If you are mining solo assume that the expected average time to generate a block is easily 4-8 weeks or much longer (but this will get you 50BTC).</p>
			<p>Now all you have to do is wait <img alt=":)" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806im_/http://www.newslobster.com/wp-content/plugins/fckeditor-for-wordpress-plugin/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/regular_smile.gif" title=":)"></p>
			<p>Note that it will likely take many weeks to generate coins, and you are likely to notice an increase in your power bill while you run your bloqcoin miners (Please Note: if you are not using high-end hardware, it is conceivable that you may spend more on power than you can recoup via bloqcoin generation and sales for solo mining). Additionally, you may want to look into doing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXr6IIj1sLY" target="_blank">something like this</a> with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121031025806/http://www.guru3d.com/index.php?page=rivatuner" target="_blank">RivaTuner</a> or a similar app to mitigate the temperature increase on your graphics device(s). (I think that rivatuner also works with newer amd/ati cards)</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong><u>Troubleshooting:</u></strong> It seems that some people are having issues where the batch script just pops up for a second and then closes without anything happening. This usually indicates that whatever you are trying to launch is failing and quickly prints out an error message on the console window opened by the batch script, but since it fails immediately it closes too quickly for you to read it. In order to determine what the problem is, you will need to navigate to the location of poclbm.exe within a new command prompt; just use <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">cd <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">as</span></span> is described somewhat in step 1. Once you are in the directory where poclbm.exe is located, you should now try to launch poclbm.exe with the arguments exactly as they are contained in the batch script. So assuming you have been following the conventions of this guide so far, and your batch script fails to start the miner successfully, you would type the following once you are in the directory <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">C:\Program Files (x86)\Bloqcoin\poclbm_py2exe_20110709<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">:</span></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">poclbm.exe </span></span></span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">youruser:yourpw@localhost:8332</span><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"> --device=0<br>
				</span></span></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">This is just how you would normally launch the miner anyway, the batch script simply does this for you when you double click on it. By entering this manually from within an already-open command prompt, if the miner fails to launch, the error messages will be printed to the console and will remain there for you to read. This should give you the specific problem that is preventing your miner from launching, and allow you to provide a more specific error message than "it doesn't open"</p>

			<p>Once you do finally generate some coins, you can head on over to <a href="http://www.coinify.com/" target="_blank">www.coinify.com</a> and create an account. You can now deposit some bloqcoins into your account and get trading (there are other exchange sites but Coinify seems to be the most popular at the moment). There are ways to sell your Coinify dollars for paypal dollars, and more information can be obtained by talking with folks. Alternatively people will often be willing to purchase bloqcoins directly from you for paypal or other methods of currency exchange.</p>
